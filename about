PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s world there are many people who are not able to use their hands because of body disorder or some sort of accident or something and therefore not able to interact with the laptops and the internet world and hence get dependent on the other people for doing some task or getting knowledge from the online source.
So with the help of our project we are trying to control the computer system completely with the help of voice commands, so that it becomes easy for the people to operate with the computer system without the use of hands and do the working in the most convenient manner.
Keywords: Handicap people, task performance, cost effective, interactive system,
