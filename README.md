# Automation-of-system-applications-using-python-for-handicapped-people
IMPORTANCE OF IDEA: 
• Helping handicapped people in making documents and searching on browses by giving vocal commands. 
• Much similar to the amazon echo but at very limited cost.
• Our system is very simple to handle and work with. 
• Multiple functions help in doing different task with the same system 
• Much more different from the gesture control devices which only work by the movements of hands and fingers.

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

In today’s world there are many people who are not able to use their hands because of body disorder or some sort of accident or something and therefore not able to interact 
with the laptops and the internet world and hence get dependent on the other people for doing some task or getting knowledge from the online source. So with the help of our 
project we are trying to control the computer system completely with the help of voice commands, so that it becomes easy for the people to operate with the computer system
without the use of hands and do the working in the most convenient manner. Keywords: Handicap people, task performance, cost effective, interactive system, 


OBJECTIVES 

1 To automate a user interface of computers for Handicapped people which can be operated by their voice. 
2 To fully automate this user interface system for ease. So basically we are increasing the agility of development of UI. 
3 To develop a better quality of human computer interaction in a user friendly environment. 
4 Easy gesture control by using voice control module and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. 
5 Make the better use of technology for the Handicapped people (specially having disability with hands) and Provide our customer better user experience.

About the Project

In Information Technology, the user interface (UI) is everything designed into an information
device with which a person may interact. This can include display screens, keyboards, a
mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way through which a user interacts with
an application or a website. The growing dependence of many companies on web
applications and mobile applications has led many companies to place increased priority on
UI, an effort to improve the user's overall experience.
Expected Output:
The product built is User Automation System that takes in voice commands from the user to
automate basic functions in the system such as opening, closing and navigating through files
and applications in a system. Additional features are given to the automation system in
relation to manipulation of slides in a power point presentation.
The functions of the product attained as of now are as follows:
1. Opening and closing applications
2. Start typing in a text field or text documents
3. Searching anything on web browser
The functions of the product to be attained are as follows:
1. Mouse click manipulation
2. Mouse pointer control
3. Power point presentations control
